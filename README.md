# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Tracker (Kenyan Context)

This is a Python-based real-time COVID-19 data tracker that fetches the latest statistics from the [disease.sh](https://disease.sh) API. It includes global and Kenyan-specific updates.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Track real-time global and Kenyan COVID-19 stats.
- Display data clearly using print statements and pandas DataFrame.
- Practice API integration and data parsing in Python.

## 🛠 Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3
- `requests` – for API calls
- `pandas` – for data display
- `datetime` – for timestamp formatting

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Paste the code from `covid_tracker_kenya.ipynb`
3. Run all cells to view global and Kenyan COVID-19 updates.

## 💡 Reflections

This project was created by *Brian Otieno*, a learner based in Nairobi. It was a practical way to learn real-time data handling, APIs, and Python basics. I learned how to fetch, structure, and display live data and apply it in a local (Kenyan) context.
